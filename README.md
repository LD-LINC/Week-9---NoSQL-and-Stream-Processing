# Week 9 Overview: NoSQL Databases, Streaming, and Big Data

This week, you'll explore modern data systems by working with NoSQL databases, real-time streaming using Kafka, and scalable storage for big data.

You'll start with core NoSQL concepts—Document, Key-Value, Column-Family, and Graph models—and understand when and why to use them. Then, you’ll apply this knowledge using MongoDB for CRUD operations, flexible schema design, and aggregation.

Next, you’ll dive into Kafka fundamentals, learning how producers, consumers, topics, and brokers enable real-time data pipelines. You’ll also compare batch vs. stream processing and explore scalable storage options like HDFS, S3, and data lakes.

The week concludes with a hands-on project where you’ll build a streaming pipeline using Kafka and MongoDB to capture, process, and store real-time data.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this week's content on NoSQL, data streaming, and big data, it's important to have a solid foundation in a few key areas. The following skills are essential for understanding the concepts and successfully completing the hands-on project.


### Python

Proficiency in Python is crucial as it will be the primary language used for scripting, data manipulation, and interacting with various services like Kafka and MongoDB.

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

While this week focuses on NoSQL databases, a strong understanding of SQL and relational database concepts is a critical prerequisite. This knowledge provides a baseline for comparison and helps you appreciate the problems NoSQL technologies are designed to solve.
